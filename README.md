# NasBuild
This is ***NOT ENDORSED BY NASCRAFT!!!***. You may use these builds __at your own risk!!!__ There will be no support whatsoever from either me or Bounser (the developer of Nascraft) if you encounter any issues using these "dev builds".

## When are they built?
These builds are done on ***every other day*** regardless of whether or not there is a new commit/push on the [repo](https://github.com/Bounser/Nascraft).
## How are they compiled?
These builds are compiled and automatically pushed to the **Releases** tab after the GitHub Actions bot completes compiling the Maven package. Builds can fail, though, so be wary!
